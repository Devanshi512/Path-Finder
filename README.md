# Path Finder

This project is basically using <strong>A* Algorithm</strong> which helps to find the shortest optimum path between two nodes.

### Overview

>> Starting Node - Orange<br />
>> Ending Node - Turquoise<br />
>> Obstacles - Black<br />
>> Shortest Optimum Path(result) - Purple<br />
>> Walkable Nodes - White<br />
>> Already Visted or Closed Nodes - Red<br />
>> Open Nodes - Green<br />

### Tech Stack

>> **Python** language with pygame library<br />

### Getting Started

* Install Python and any relevant IDE
* Run path_finder.py file into the IDE<br />
***Tip: Very first node would be "Start Node", Second would be "End Node" and rest of the nodes in black would be obstacles.<br /> 
        To clear or reset the whole grid, press "C" key. To run the program using any created scenario, press "Spacebar" key***
